## Globus

To learn how to use Globus, everyone should start with the [Globus for Individuals Tutorials](./globus_individual_tutorial.md) to become familiar with how to get on Globus and how it works.

If you manage a lab or a Research Core on campus, you may also be interested in our [Globus for Groups Tutorials](./globus_group_tutorial.md). Research Core managers and directors should please [Contact Support](../../../help/support.md) to start a conversation around Data Management good practices.
